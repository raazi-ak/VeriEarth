**LOVE THIS ENERGY — LET’S GO!** 🚀

If you’ve got 20 hours, 4 people, and pretrained models (bless you for that decision 🙏), we can ABSOLUTELY knock out a slick MVP that’ll wow the judges and feel like a real product. Here’s a starting point — a **collab doc outline** covering features, use cases, stakeholders, and the technical game plan. Once this is good, I’ll break it into a **work split for the 4 of you.**

# 🌍 EMaaS — Hackathon MVP Master Doc

---

## 🧩 **Core Features (What Your MVP Will Deliver)**

| Feature | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🛢️ Oil Spill Detection | Detects oil spills from **Sentinel-1 SAR imagery** | ✅ Must-Have |
| 🌫️ Air Quality Estimation | Estimates **PM2.5, NO2, SO2, AQI levels** from Sentinel-5P | ✅ Must-Have |
| 🗺️ Interactive Map Dashboard | Map-based interface to **visualize pollution events** | ✅ Must-Have |
| 🔗 Blockchain Event Logging | Each detected event gets **hashed & logged to blockchain (Polygon testnet)** | ⚠️ Nice-to-Have |
| 📊 Pollution Timeline | Historical pollution events per region (basic time slider) | ✅ Must-Have |
| 📥 Data Export (CSV/JSON) | Users can download detected events data | Optional |
| 🚀 REST API | Basic API to fetch latest detected events | Optional |

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Key Stakeholders (Who Cares About This)**

| Stakeholder | Why They Care | Example Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🌍 Government Regulators | Need independent, auditable pollution monitoring | Verify industrial compliance, disaster response |
| 🏭 Industries (Ports, Factories) | Need ESG compliance reports, early warnings | Pre-emptively address pollution violations |
| 🚢 Shipping Companies | Need real-time oil spill alerts | Route adjustment, insurance claims |
| 📊 ESG Funds | Need transparent pollution data for investment decisions | Assess environmental risk for investments |
| 🧪 Researchers | Need open-access pollution data | Study climate patterns, policy impact |
| 🏠 General Public | Wants real pollution data, not "cooked" numbers | Health & lifestyle decisions |

---

## 💡 **Primary Use Cases (Real-Life Applications)**

| Use Case | Flow |
| --- | --- |
| 🌊 **Oil Spill Detection for Maritime Authorities** | Detect spill → Notify authority → Track spread over time |
| 🌫️ **AQI Monitoring for Smart Cities** | Daily AQI heatmaps → Compare industrial zones vs residential |
| 🏭 **Compliance Monitoring for Factories** | Detect emissions spikes → Cross-check with self-reported data |
| 🔗 **Blockchain Auditable Pollution History** | Immutable pollution logs per region → Open access for all |

---

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack (Prelim Choices — All No Hardware)**

| Component | Tech |
| --- | --- |
| 🌍 Satellite Data | Sentinel-1 (SAR), Sentinel-5P (Atmospheric), OpenAQ (for ground fusion) |
| 🤖 Pretrained Models | Oil Spill Segmentation (U-Net), AQI Estimation (multimodal CNN) |
| 🛠️ Backend | Python (FastAPI or Flask) |
| 🗺️ Dashboard | React + Mapbox/Leaflet |
| 🔗 Blockchain Logging | Polygon (testnet) via Infura/Alchemy + IPFS (optional for data dump) |
| 🐳 Deployment | Docker (optional if you need) |

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Flow (High-Level)**

1. **Satellite Data Fetcher (Python Script)**  
   - Query Copernicus API for Sentinel-1 (SAR) + Sentinel-5P data
   - Preprocess imagery (cropping, scaling)

2. **Model Inference (Python)**  
   - Oil Spill Detection (binary segmentation — oil/no oil)
   - AQI Estimation (NO2, SO2, PM2.5 → combined AQI)

3. **Event Database (SQLite/Postgres)**  
   - Store detected events locally (timestamp, location, type, confidence, optional image)

4. **Blockchain Logger (Python)**  
   - Hash event metadata + store on **Polygon testnet** (simple hash + IPFS link if needed)

5. **Dashboard (React)**  
   - Map with:
     - Pollution Events (pins/heatmap)
     - Event Details Popup (confidence, type, timestamp)
     - Historical Timeline Slider (playback pollution over time)

6. **API (Optional for Bonus)**  
   - Simple endpoints for:
     - `/events/latest`
     - `/events/history`

## 📊 **Work Split (4 People — Assign Roles)**

| Role | Person | Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📡 Data & Model Integration | Person 1 | Data fetch, model inference, preprocess pipelines |
| 🧠 Backend/Blockchain Dev | Person 2 | Flask/FastAPI API, Blockchain logging (Polygon) |
| 🗺️ Frontend/Map Dev | Person 3 | React + Mapbox/Leaflet, pollution map UI |
| 🔗 Docs & Pitch Master | Person 4 | Prepare hackathon pitch deck, document architecture, finalize use cases & business pitch |

---

## 🕒 **Timeline Suggestion (20 Hours)**

| Time | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| 0-2 hrs | Team sync + role split + repo setup |
| 2-6 hrs | Data fetch + pretrained model runs |
| 6-10 hrs | Backend & Blockchain basic pipeline |
| 10-14 hrs | Frontend map & dashboard |
| 14-18 hrs | Integration + Testing |
| 18-20 hrs | Polish + Pitch Deck + Demo Recording (if needed) |

## 🎤 **Want a Killer Pitch Deck Template?**

I can whip up:
- 6-8 **slick slides** (Problem, Solution, Demo, Market, Business Model, Team)
- Modern design, clean visuals
- Technical diagrams if you want (pipeline flow, system architecture)

---

## 🔥 **Immediate Action Items for You**

1. Confirm if you like this split — any teammate preferences or tech changes?
2. Should I draft the **pitch deck skeleton**?
3. Do you want **starter code stubs** for Python scripts & React frontend?

The faster you answer, the faster we get rolling. Clock’s ticking ⏰ — let’s crush this! 💪
